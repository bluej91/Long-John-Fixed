# Long-John-Fixed
1. footer.html - Code implementation removed that altered site structure orientation.
...............................
 <style>
        body {
           width: 100%;
           height: 100%;
           -moz-transform: rotate(180deg);
           -webkit-transform: rotate(180deg);
           -ms-transform: rotate(180deg);
           -o-transform: rotate(180deg);
           transform: rotate(180deg);
        }
        </style>
...............................   


2. Header.scss - No CSS rendering on site due to missing Header.scss file in layouts folder. Did a search on all theme assets for header.scss. Searched all files within assets folder individually to confirm if file possibly could have been renamed. (Found in _body.scss code had been commented out or disabled.) To fix CSS issue, replaced header file with a copy of the original header.scss.

3. Header title left aligns on the storefront. Troubleshooted the issue by checking all elements around the header element. Was able to find a quick fix that would rectify the issue. 

Code modified for alignment issue:
...............
.header-logo--left {
    //text-align: left;

    @include breakpoint("medium") {
        margin-left: remCalc(40px);
    }
}
